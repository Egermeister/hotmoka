\textbf{About the author}

Fausto Spoto holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Pisa, Italy.
Currently, he works as an Associate Professor at the University of Verona, Italy, where
he teaches courses on programming languages and software development.
His research interests are related to the development of high quality software,
also through automatic code verification. His interest for blockchain stems
from the fact that the latter is a natural context where
software must be correct and reliable.
